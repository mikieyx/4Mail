# 4Mail README

# Functionality
The following are the main features of 4Mail:

1. Add a task to the todo list: Users can create and manage their to-do lists by adding tasks that need to be completed. The system stores these tasks and allows the user to view them anytime.

2. Connect to external News Articles API: Users can read news articles by clicking on the news page. The system uses an external news articles API to gather articles and then displays them in an organized fashion for the user.

3. Create an account (register): Users can create an account by filling in a registration form that asks for a username, email address, and password. After submitting the form, the system checks the validity of the input and then creates the account.

4. Send an email: Users can send emails to other users by composing a message and specifying the recipient's email address. The system then checks the validity of the recipient's email address and sends the message.

5. Log In/ Log Out: Users can log in to their accounts to access their emails, to-do lists, and other features, and they can log out when they are done using the system.
